# Privacy Policy for Rephrase AI

**Last Updated:** January 2, 2026

Rephrase AI ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension handles your data.

**1. Data Collection**
We do not store any personal data. The extension processes text that you type into input fields on websites solely for the purpose of analyzing tone and generating suggestions.

**2. Data Usage**
- **Text Input:** The text you type is sent to our secure proxy server and then to a third-party AI provider (Hugging Face) to generate rewrites.
- **No Storage:** Your text is NOT saved, stored, or used to train AI models by us. It is processed in real-time and discarded immediately after the suggestion is returned.

**3. User Settings**
We use your browser's local storage to save your "On/Off" preference. This data never leaves your browser.

**4. Third-Party Services**
We use Hugging Face Inference API for text analysis. Please refer to their privacy policy for more details on how they handle API requests.

**5. Contact**
If you have questions about this policy, please contact us via the Chrome Web Store support page.
