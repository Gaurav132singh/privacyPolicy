Privacy Policy for Quick Screen Recorder


Overview

Quick Screen Recorder is a Chrome extension designed solely to allow users to record their screen, browser tab, or application window and download the recording as a video file. User privacy is a top priority.

Data Collection

Quick Screen Recorder does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal or sensitive user data.

The extension does not:

Collect personal information

Track browsing activity

Read website content

Monitor user behavior

Store recordings on external servers

Use analytics or tracking tools

Screen Recordings

All screen recordings are created and processed locally on the user’s device using browser-provided APIs. Recorded video files are saved directly to the user’s local storage and are never uploaded or transmitted to any server.

Permissions Usage

The extension requests the following permissions strictly to support its core functionality:

desktopCapture – to allow users to select and record their screen, browser tab, or application window.

tabs – to identify the currently active tab when the user chooses to record a tab.

offscreen – to handle media recording using browser APIs that require a document context.

downloads – to save recorded video files to the user’s device.

These permissions are used only when initiated by the user and are not used for any other purpose.

Third-Party Access

Quick Screen Recorder does not use third-party services, trackers, analytics tools, or external APIs.

Data Sharing

No user data is shared with third parties because no user data is collected.

Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated if the extension’s functionality changes. Any updates will be reflected on this page.
