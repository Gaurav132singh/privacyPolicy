# Privacy Policy for MyNotes

**Effective date:** [Date of publication]

Gaurav Singh ("us", "we", or "our") operates the MyNotes mobile application (the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information Collection and Use

We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.

### Types of Data Collected

#### **Personal Data**
*   **Notes:** We store the notes you create directly on your device. This data is stored locally and is not uploaded to our servers.
*   **Audio Data:** Our app includes a speech-to-text feature. To use this, we request access to your device's microphone. The audio is processed by the Android operating system's speech recognition service to convert it to text. We do not store or transmit this audio data to our servers.

#### **Usage Data**
Like many mobile applications, we may collect standard, anonymous information about how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your device's operating system, device type, crash logs, and other diagnostic data to help us improve the app.

## How We Use Your Information
*   **To provide and maintain the Service:** Your notes are stored on your device so you can access them.
*   **To enable features:** Audio data is used only to power the speech-to-text feature.
*   **To improve the app:** We use anonymous crash logs and usage data to identify and fix bugs and improve the user experience.

## Data Storage and Security
All of your personal notes are stored locally on your device in a private, sandboxed database. This data is not sent to any external server and is as secure as the device it is on. We value your trust in providing us your information and strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
